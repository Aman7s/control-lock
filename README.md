# control-lock
I am trying to make an lock app.
It will have lock the apps and we have to give reason to open it
It has main purpose to stop user from wasting their pecesious time on apps.
It also has an password lock after user submit the reason for opening that app.
In last we will give user a weekly report of that app so user can see what is the reaso that he opens that app and so he can improve.
So we have to store reason also.
